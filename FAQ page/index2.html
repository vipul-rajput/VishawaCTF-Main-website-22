    <b>What is CTF?</b><br>
    <hr size="10" color= white>
    CTF stands for "Capture the Flag". CTFs are a type of computer security competition. 
    Certain pieces of information, called "flags", are placed on servers, encrypted, hidden,
    or otherwise stored somewhere difficult to access. During the competition, different challenges
    are released which allow the participants to reverse engineer, break, hack, decrypt, and do whatever
    it takes to capture that flag. When a team submits this flag to a scoring page, they will get points for the submission.
